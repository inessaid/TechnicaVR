2019 Technica

Medical tutorial, classroom with exam table 

Technology
- Background: unity asset
- Doctor: unity asset
- Music: mp3 files downloaded from spotify 
- Technica logo: c# in unity
- Person: unity + blender objects
- Object (organ, nerve, brain, etc) - blender
- Backend store: Open Anatomy Atlas body parts, info

Problem
- High school students are having trouble learning anatomy (textbook based, no interactivity, boring, short attention span, expensive models)

Target: high school students

Solution: VR app for the human body 

- No textbook, more interactive and engaging 
- Accommodates a short attention span
- Accommodates other learning styles 
- Open-source model
- Easily updatable model 
- Oculus rift has multiple functions 
- Less expensive Sony model

Learning styles 
- visual: human body models, text on screen
- auditory: doctor speaks 
- kinesthetic: touch / interact with the body parts 
- social: multiplayer version (future)

Technologies
- Unity 2019.2.11 / C#
- Blender
- Git
- Visual Studio 
- Oculus Rift 
- OpenStax Anatomy & Physiology 
- NaturalReader 16

I’m Anna and I worked on functionality for the human body objects, backend data, and audio files for the Technica VR app. I tested an initial female model in Unity using C#, wrote scripts to rotate and move organs, and collaborated on code with my teammates. I also pulled medical data from OpenStax Anatomy & Physiology and created audio files that auditory learners can hear playing inside the app when they explore human physiology. 

I’m Sabrine and I worked on initial research of Unity models and the movement of human body objects, and learned a lot about C# in the process. The Unity assets included a test female body, systems, and helper robot to educate the VR user.

I’m Ines and I worked on the VR app environment using Unity and C#. I created the medical room, assembled Unity models, and tested the user experience with an Oculus Rift. I also learned version control with Git to collaborate with my team!

Final post 

I attended Technica this past weekend, the international all-female hackathon and won the 
hashtag
#GoBeyond hack prize for our project! We developed a VR app that will help primary education students learn human anatomy through an interactive VR environment geared towards all learning-styles (not just textbook whizzes). 

It was such a privilege working with these ladies! They were so dedicated and invested in both learning new technologies and pulling our project together. I felt so lucky to be a part of this experience, and can't wait for next year!
