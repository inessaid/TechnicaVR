The heart is the first functional organ to develop in a fetus. It resides within the pericardial sac and is located in the mediastinal space within the thoracic cavity. Between the pericardial sac and the heart is the pericardial cavity, which is filled with lubricating serous fluid. The walls of the heart are composed of an outer epicardium, a thick myocardium, and an inner lining layer of endocardium. The human heart consists of a pair of atria, which receive blood and pump it into a pair of ventricles, which pump blood into the vessels.
