# TechnicaVR

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project is wanting to build something that can make a difference in the way students learn. We wanted to make something that can enhance a students learning experience by allowing them interact with the subject in a VR environment.

## Description
technicAnatomy is a Virtual Reality application hosted on the Oculus Quest. It is an application for learning anatomy and is aimed at any student who needs to learn Anatomy, such as; medical students, nursing students, occupational therapist students, etc. Within the application, the user will be placed in a medical exam room environment where a human body is found and the parts of the body are interactive. The student can select which ever organ they wish to exam and interact with it. Audio will be provided upon organ selection to provide the student with information on their selection.

## Technologies Used
* Unity3D - platform to build the VR environment
* C# - driver for backend development
* Blender - 3D models of human organs
